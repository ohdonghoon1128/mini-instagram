    1. implemented login, register, edit, profile and delete function in authentication.js
    2. tested with mongodb. it works fine


To do later
- /app_api/controllers/authentications.js
    deleteUser must clean all comments and photos that related to the user

- add profile page
- add user account delete function on client side

- add photo delete photo edit photo page
- implement photo handler on server side

- Revisit DELETE user function on (app_api/controllers/authentication.js, app_api/routes/index.js)
    client side delete user button should popup confirmation window and force user enter password
    right now use can just click button without password and it through exception on server


- app_client/common/directives/navigation.controller.js
    fix $windlow.location.assign(vm.currentPath);
    ex) if im in localhost:3001/#!/user/someUserId, and login, then it will forward me to localhost:3001/user/someUserID
    and response with not found error

- app_client/addPhotoModal/addPhotoModal.controller.js
    add some validation
